## SVD-based methods
initialmatrixtext8.ipynb is to create the raw word-context matrix for text8 corpus.
text8creatematrixinneed.ipynb is to create the needed matrix and the spearman's correlation coefficient for text8 corpus.

initialmatrixbnc.ipynb is to create the raw word-context matrix for BNC corpus.
bnccreatematrixinneed.ipynb is to create the needed matrix and the spearman's correlation coefficient for BNC corpus.


## GloVe
loadglove.ipynb is to obtain the spearman's correlation coefficient for GloVe.

## SGNS
loadword2vec.ipynb is to obtain the spearman's correlation coefficient for SGNS.

## Results are obtained by text8bncevaluation.ipynb
text8bncevaluation.ipynb is to create the results in the paper for text8 corpus and BNC corpus.

In addition, foobar.py includes functions which are used in other codes.
The file "cmd command to obtain the vectors from GloVe and SGNS" is the cmd command to obtain the GloVe and SGNS vectors.
